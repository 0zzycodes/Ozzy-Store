        <h4>Cleaning</h4>
        <p>
          When your clothes need a wash, don’t simply stick them in the washer
          as you might do usually; follow these guidelines. Use a gentle
          cleaning cycle, and opt for an eco-friendly detergent; not only is
          that better for the environment, it is more gentle for the bodycon
          fabric too and keeps everything as fresh and clean as possible. If you
          have any excessive stains, pre-soak the clothing before you put them
          in the washing machine. Wash shirts separate from other clothes. As
          with usual washing routines, separate light and dark colors and wash
          them separately.
        </p>

      <div className="block">
        <h4>Do Not Bleach</h4>
        <p>
          As with all bodycon material do not use bleach at any time. The
          chemicals involved with the bleach can damage the fibers and
          completely ruin your clothing. As an alternative, use baking soda to
          brighten. Keep your clothes away from chemical agents that will fade
          them too. Some examples are: chlorine bleach, hydrogen peroxide, some
          toothpastes and teeth whiteners.
        </p>

      <div className="block">
        <h4>Drying and Ironing</h4>
        <p>
          When the time comes to dry your bodycon clothing, the best option is a
          washing line if one is available (and the weather is fine!). If you
          decide to use a tumble dryer instead, ensure that the setting you use
          is mild and don’t do it for any longer than you need to or the fibrers
          could be damaged. When they are dry and ready to iron, head for the
          lowest heat setting to avoid any damage and use light steam.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div className="block">
        <h4>Storage</h4>
        <p>
          When the time comes to store your clothing, store them as you would
          your other clothes. However, be aware that heat can damage bodycon
          fibers, so pay attention to any heat sources that could cause the
          fibers to be damaged. Such examples could be a wardrobe near a heat
          vent or radiator, or even near a water heater. If your wardrobe or
          drawers comes into contact with any regular heat, consider moving them
          to a cooler part of the room, or store your bodycon clothes elsewhere.
